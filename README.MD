Water My Plants App

    Water My Plants reminds users of a watering schedule to ensure all their plants are healthy and happy.

Knowing when your plants need to be watered is a tough task for anyone to handle. With the Water My Plants App, you will not only be able to keep a picture of your plant with you at all times but also know how often they should be watered.

This is an app designed during a Lambda School build week.
